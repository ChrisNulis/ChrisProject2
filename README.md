*TECH STACK
=================
- MongoDB
- JavaScript
- Express.js
- Node.js
- HTML
- CSS

*DESCRIPTION
=================
- A CRUD, RESTful, MVC structured Funko POP! Collection App, where users can read, add, edit, delete items from the website. </br>
- Includes a simple authentication/Login feature using BCrypt and express where only a registered -and logged in- user have the ability to create, edit and delete items.

*PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED
========================
- For some reason, the styling isn't transferred properly in Heroku even though everything works properly locally.
- Unable to find reliable Funko POP! API

*HOW PROBLEMS WERE FIXED
===========================
- Due to time constrain, I utilized bootstrap and style the page directly in .js file (not recommended)!!!
- Created my own list of items to seed the data manually
